                <p>Arch Linux took over my life in my Sophomore year of highschool. During my cybersec phase where all I did in school were random CTF's and linux stuff, I installed Arch on a VM probably 100 times before I started to get a grasp for it. What intrigued me the most was the ability to be whatever I want.</p>

                <p>Right now I run a very simple setup with i3. I REALLY love how little junk I need running on my computer to be able to do what I want. The tradeoff is a bit of a longer setup time, but heck, I enjoy it.</p>
